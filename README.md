# pic-control-board

General purpose control board based on a PIC16 microcontroller.

## Features
- RS-232 compatible
- I2C headers
- On-board power regulation
- Membrane keypad headers
- HD44780 LCD controller support (Usually 16x2 LCD displays)
- In circuit serial programming (ICSP) support

## Purpose
This board was originally meant to be the control module for a lab bench power supply.
After some thought and redesign this motherboard was split from the rest of the system and converted in a general purpose
control unit. It can be seen as a development board of sorts.
